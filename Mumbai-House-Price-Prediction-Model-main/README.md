# Mumbai House Price Prediction Model
The provided code builds and evaluates two regression models for predicting house prices in Mumbai. After preprocessing the dataset and removing outliers, Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Random Forest Regression models were trained. The Random Forest model, outperforming SLR, demonstrated higher R-squared scores and lower errors during cross-validation and evaluation on the validation and test sets. This suggests that the Random Forest model effectively captures underlying patterns in Mumbai's real estate data, making it a robust predictor for house prices. The models provide insights valuable for stakeholders in Mumbai's real estate market, aiding in pricing and decision-making processes.
